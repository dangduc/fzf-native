This is a package that provides fuzzy matching scoring based on the
fzf algorithm (by [[https://github.com/junegunn][junegunn]]) through a
dynamic module for a native C implementation of fzf,
[[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim][telescope-fzf-native.nvim]].

** Installation
*** MELPA
Not yet on MELPA.

*** Manually
Clone / download this repository and modify your ~load-path~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/fzf-native/" user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

*** Straight Examples
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; Configuration that builds dynamic module locally.
(use-package fzf-native
  :straight
  (:repo "dangduc/fzf-native"
   :host github
   :files (:defaults "*.c" "*.h" "*.txt"))
  :init
  (setq fzf-native-always-compile-module t)
  :config
  (fzf-native-load-own-build-dyn))

; Configuration that uses pre-built dynamic module.
(use-package fzf-native
  :straight
  (:repo "dangduc/fzf-native"
   :host github
   :files (:defaults "bin"))
  :config
  (fzf-native-load-dyn))
#+end_src

** Use-Cases

[[https://github.com/jojojames/fussy][Fussy]]: ~fzf-native~ is used as
one of several choose-your-own scoring backends in ~fussy~, a package
that provides a ~completing-style~ for intelligent matching and
sorting.

** Building the native libraries

#+begin_src bash
mkdir build && cmake -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS='-O3 -march=native' && cmake --build build
#+end_src

** Credit
All credit for fzf.c goes to the
[[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim][telescope-fzf-native.nvim]]
project. Much credit for Emacs module binding code goes to the
[[https://github.com/axelf4/hotfuzz][hotfuzz]] project.
