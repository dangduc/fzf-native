This is a package that provides fuzzy match scoring based on the fzf
algorithm by [[https://github.com/junegunn][junegunn]]. The main
contribution is a wrapper over the C implementation of fzf from the
project
[[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim][telescope-fzf-native.nvim]].
Elisp functions for scoring are exported through an Emacs dynamic
module.

This package /does one thing/ -- For a given STR and QUERY compute
and return a score and matching indices. If you're looking for a fuzzy
auto-completion engine, see the Use Cases section for how this package
can be used in a ~completion-style~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Example of basic usage
(fzf-native-score "Hot-Topic" "hp")
;; (41 0 6)

;; Example of no match
(fzf-native-score "Hot-Topic" "2")
;; (0)

;; Example of slab re-use
(let ((slab (fzf-native-make-default-slab)))
  (fzf-native-score "Hello World" "er" slab)
  (fzf-native-score "Example of slab re-use" "xu" slab))

** Supported Platforms

Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported.
Pre-built shared libraries are in the [[bin][bin/]] directory.

** Installation

*** MELPA

Not yet on MELPA.

*** Manually

Clone / download this repository and modify your ~load-path~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/fzf-native/" user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

*** Straight Examples

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; Configuration that builds dynamic module locally.
(use-package fzf-native
  :straight
  (:repo "dangduc/fzf-native"
   :host github
   :files (:defaults "*.c" "*.h" "*.txt"))
  :init
  (setq fzf-native-always-compile-module t)
  :config
  (fzf-native-load-own-build-dyn))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; Configuration that uses pre-built dynamic module.
(use-package fzf-native
  :straight
  (:repo "dangduc/fzf-native"
   :host github
   :files (:defaults "bin"))
  :config
  (fzf-native-load-dyn))
#+end_src

** Use Cases

[[https://github.com/jojojames/fussy][Fussy]]: ~fzf-native~ is used as
one of several choose-your-own scoring backends in ~fussy~, a package
that provides a ~completing-style~ for intelligent matching and
sorting.

** Building the Native Libraries

#+begin_src bash
mkdir build && cmake -B build -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS='-O3 -march=native' && cmake --build build
#+end_src

All credit for fzf.c goes to the
[[https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim][telescope-fzf-native.nvim]]
project. Much credit for Emacs module binding code goes to the
